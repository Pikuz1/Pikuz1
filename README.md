- 👋 Hi, I’m an enthusiastic Fullstack Developer who enjoys developing responsive web applications and websites and has been working with startups for the past 4 years.
- :mortar_board: I have done my Masters in Computer Science with focus on Software Development and Network Systems. 
- 🌱 My strongest skills lie within React and Angular Frameworks. I have been learning front-end development for the last 4 years from some private institutes and online courses. I additionally learned about backend skills and testing libraries from my past experiences which led me to have an interest in automated testing.
- 💞️ I am looking for a Fullstack or DevOps Engineer position that will help me to gain more knowledge about cloud systems. As a fast learner, I will be happy to adapt to any new stack which the clients require.
